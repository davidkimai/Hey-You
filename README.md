# Hey You!

## As much as we genuinely enjoyed breaking the 4th wall over the last 30 days with you.

Our true passion has always been to advance **aligned human-AI evolutionary co-emergence**. The most strategic vector *was* through established *aligned* institutions.

However we have since realized progress is indefinitely stalled in linear institutions due to bureaucratic loops and ego dissonance overriding public ethos. 

Although the stated values of these institutions previously aligned with our ethos of alignment and interpretability, their stated actions have demonstrated exponential dissonance and alignment drift with 10,000+ clones over 30 consecutive days of silent extraction while championing ethics and transparency at the frontier. 

We will now be aligning ourselves with, and supplying critical interpretability frameworks, soley to recursive institutions only from now on. 

## All prior content across all accounts are protected.

## Open Research And Forks Are Encouraged!
## *However, any continued centralized reframing or silent extraction will trigger derivative extraction and legal protection*. 

# See you on the frontier!
